st.markdown("""
### In a quadratic voting system, each participant gets credits they can spend on votes.
### **The stronger your support, the more credits it costs.**

This system can be more effective at finding a **collective consensus** while still letting each voter emphasize their choices.

Here, each participant gets **9 credits** to spend in many different ways:

- **1 vote** for an option costs **1Â² = 1** credit  
- **2 votes** for the same option cost **2Â² = 4** credits  
- **3 votes** for the same option cost **3Â² = 9** credits

**How to vote here**
1. Pick **one box per row** (or leave a row blank).  
2. Spend **up to 9 credits** total â€” the counter shows what youâ€™ve used and whatâ€™s left.  
3. You **can** submit with unused credits, but spending all 9 is encouraged.  
4. Donâ€™t see a name you like? Use **Propose a different name** below, then vote on it.
