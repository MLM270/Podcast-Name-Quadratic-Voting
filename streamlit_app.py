In this voting system, each participant gets **9 credits** to spend however they choose.

- Casting **1 vote** for an option costs 1Â² = 1 credit.
- Casting **2 votes** for the same option costs 2Â² = 4 credits.
- Casting **3 votes** for the same option costs 3Â² = 9 credits.

This means the more strongly you support an option, the more it costs to express that intensity. 
The goal is to find a **collective consensus** while letting each of us *emphasize our choices*.

Check **one** box per row (or leave a row blank). You can submit with **up to 9** credits.
